# D3DataVisualization
This project shows a data visualization created using D3 library, html,css and Javascript. The resultant bar graph shows the gross sales of the food stores at a university. The top 3 items from each of the 9 stores were chosen to create this visualization. A wampserver was used to show the viz on the browser.
